Today is a big fat day for me, with Cinnamon officially being announced and out in the wild. I'm so unbelievably excited to share it with you, it's been a roller coaster getting started. Cinnamon represents one facet of a butterfly's cocoon that I'm beginning to push my way out of. So this is a moment I'm taking to share what Cinnamon has come to mean to me.

There was so much more to the industry than superheroes, and I found the niches that I had been so desperately searching for. I'm grateful to mentors like Laurenn McCubbin, Mike Laughead, Emi Gennis, and CM Campbell. They opened my eyes and pushed me to do my best work.

The story grew organically around my experiences owning a cat. But she also reflects myself, she is a bit of a bull in a china closet, and I've spent my fair share of time inadvertantly ruffling people's feathers.
