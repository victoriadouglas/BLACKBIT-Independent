Let's be honest, art school is an extremely expensive option for most budding artists. It has it's place, it was great for building a supportive creative network and meeting likeminded peers. It can be a good opportunity for some people. But it's not for everyone. Whether you choose to go the academic route or not, one of the most valuable takeaways for me was my bookshelf of art books. So I wanted to share my list of essential reading. These are the books that shaped my art, and provided the foundation for me to succeed in art school and beyond. This list definitely has a comic lean, but I've thrown in a lot of other books that are relevant in different areas. But in the end, these are the books that made the most difference to ME, and your mileage may vary.
