# 2024

Another year, another top list. This is the biggest one yet! Is that because I played more games? Probably.

## #1 // Death Stranding: Director's Cut
A big long summer play, between semesters. Probably wouldn't have finished it otherwise. It's my first Kojima game after missing all the Metal Gear games, and I immediately get it. This game certainly isn't for everyone, but it was tailor made for me. The man who has heart attacks every couple of minutes is named Heartman. It's so on the nose it's incredible.

## #2 // Subnautica
This took me two years to finish, because I pulled out a giant piece of sketching paper, and started mapping out the world as I explored, like an amateur cartographer. It made the experience so much richer. After Outer Wilds, I knew I'd play this some day, and it lived up to the expectations.

## #3 // Factorio
After playing Factorio for four years, it finally made it onto the top list. Part of that is the Space Age expansion coming out, part of it is that this was the year I finally launched a rocket. Now to head to other planets. Wow what a game.

## #4 // Balatro

## #5 // Case of the Golden Idol

## #6 // Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisom

## #7 // Yakuza: Like a Dragon

## #8 // Vampire Survivors

# 2023
This was the year I got a Steam Deck! Devestating for my free time. But a fantastic handheld and totally got me through a ton of my backlog.

## #1 // Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
I am probably in the minority opinion, but I loved Tears of the Kingdom way, way more than BOTW. The story was everything I wanted BOTW to be, especially the end fight, which was some best-in-series stuff. Really, it might be my favorite Zelda game period, and that's even as someone who played Ocarina of Time on launch. It's a masterpiece for me.

## #2 // Baldur's Gate 3
I had never played a Baldur's Gate, and I haven't played DnD since college. But Sam and I jumped right into a co-op run and had a blast. It's pretty mind-boggling how expansive the world actually is, this will easily be talked about in the best games of the decade.

## #3 // Elden Ring
This is a game that I loved every second of playing, but I really wish I was better at. My reflexes continue to be ass. So I made it all the way to the Altus Plateau and just pooped out. I'll finish it one day.

## #4 // Chants of Sennar
At only nine hours from start to finish, it's a short one. But for fans of Return of the Obra Dinn, or even Outer Wilds, it's a fantastic game of translating foreign languages.

## Honorable Mentions

### Super Mario Bros. Wonder
I'm admittedly not the biggest fan of the 2D mario platformers, especially after playing DK: Tropical Freeze and getting a reminder that good 2D platforming is out there. But this was a pleasant surprise! Not a difficult game, but charming enough to not feel bored.

### Dave the Diver

### Inscryption

### No Man's Sky

### Trackmania

### Slay the Spire

### Deathloop

# 2022

## #1 // Noita
Oh boy this game hit my top ten list, and will probably never leave it. A tough as nails roguelike that will kill you with no remorse. You are a Finnish witch on a quest for power, and you build wands out of spell chunks to fire at enemies. But the chunks are really granular, and can lead to some really fun spell-logic that lobs increasingly weird and dangerous spells all around you. If you succeed, it's because you got smart. If you died, it's your fault. I can't stop playing it.

## #2 // Xenoblade Chronicles 3
A new Xenoblade! And I played the hell out of it. Great story, probably my favorite of the series (outside of the last chapter of Xenoblade 2). The combat is great, the team mechanics are real fun.

## #3 // Disco Elysium
Finally got around to playing Disco Elysium. Yep, it's as good as everyone says.

## #4 // Kirby and the Forgotten Land
Easily the best kirby game in the last decade. What a return to form, and to do it in 3D! Loved the bigger transformations, the charm, the music.

## Honorable Mentions

### Factorio
I kept playing Factorio. I can't quit you.

### Splatoon 3

### Dead Cells
