First of all, huge congrats to the entire CCAD graduating class of 2020. It's a big deal. I'm honored to have graduated college alongside so many talented people from so many walks of life.

It's a tough time. COVID-19 took a huge bite out of academia, and everyone has been scrambling for answers and solutions. My last semester was the weirdest of my entire life. It's the perfect capstone to the meandering and circuituous route I've taken to get this degree over the past ten years. I definitely had some romanticized ideas about _that day_. It was very bittersweet. I loved every second I had at the Columbus College of Art and Design, it changed my life for the better. I gush about that all the time, and it will never stop being true.

It's a weird time to be entering the work force. Quarantine is slowly petering out, we are all poking our heads out of the rabbit holes.

The future is looking bright, but that might just be the horizon on fire.
