                        <p>Oh yeah, baby, it's the (REMMI-award winning) book that started it all. CINNAMON started as my final project in my senior year of undergrad. I'll go back and make more one day, I swear. I love that damn cat.</p>
                        <p>"Cinnamon is just your perfectly ordinary, average housecat. At least until we get a glimpse of the world through her eyes! Countertops become skyscrapers, cat toys become biker gangs, and perilous giant robots rampage on the daily! Get dropped kicked onto the action packed streets of Big Kitchen City, as she fights the dark forces that dare to keep her from her favorite treat... Catnip!"</p>
                        <p>Find this book out in the wild, it pops up from time to time. Link goes to Thriftbooks, but it's not currently in print.</p>
