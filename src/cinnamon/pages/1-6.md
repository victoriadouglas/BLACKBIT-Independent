The entirety of Cinnamon is inspired by my cat, Ripley. We got her 3 months before I started my senior year, right as I was coming up with ideas for my thesis comic. Every plot point is directly tied back to her real life shenanigans, so much got left on the editting room floor. She is a frenetic, wild ball of energy, but I love her so much.
