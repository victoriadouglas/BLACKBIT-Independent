When I was young, and lived in Okinawa, there was a huge jellyfish migration one summer. We lived right on the beach, and I would go swimming often. I had swam out to the line of buoys that marked where the cool, strong kids were allowed to swim out to. I realized I was absolutely surrounded by baby jellyfish, and I panicked. I've never been more scared in my life, and I had to be rescued and dragged back to shore. They were too small to sting, but I was more scared of them than the coral snakes that were legitimately able to kill you.
